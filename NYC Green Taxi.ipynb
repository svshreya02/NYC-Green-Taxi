    "### The Model\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "The initial dataset contained 1494926 transactions with 21 time-series, categorical and numerical variables. In order to build the final model, four phases were followed (1) data cleaning, (2) feature engineering (3) exploratory data analysis and (4) model creation\n",
    "\n",
    "The cleaning consisted in drop zero variance variables (Ehail_fee), replacing invalid with the most frequent values in each categorical variable whereas the median was used for continuous numerical variables. Invalid values could be missing values or values not allowed for specific variables as per the [dictionary of variables](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_green.pdf). In this part, variables were also converted in their appropriate format such datetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature engineering part created 10 new variables derived from pickup and dropoff locations and timestamps, trip distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the exploration, each variable was carefully analyzed and compared to other variables and eventually the target variable, Percentage tip. All numerical variables were found to follow lognormal or power law distributions althouth there was found no linear relationship between numerical and the target variable. An interesting insight was uncovered in the distribution of the percentage tip. It was found that only 40% of the transactions paid tip. And 99.99% of these payments were done by credit cards. This inspired me to build the predictive model in two stages (1) classification model to find out weither a transaction will pay tip and (2) regression model to find the percentage of the tip only if the transaction was classified as a tipper. Another insight was that the most frequent percentage is 18% which corresponds to the usual restaurant gratuity rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "With lack of linear relationship between independent and depend variables, the predictive model was built on top of the random forest regression and gradient boosting classifier algorithms implemented in sklearn after routines to optimize best parameters. A usable script to make predictions as attached to this notebook and available in the same directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The code to make predictions is provided in the same directory as tip_predictor.py and the instructions are in the recommendation part of this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following, each part of the analysis is fully explained with accompanying python code"

For instance, people are more friendly and less stressful to easily tip over the weekend. They were derived from pickup time\n",

At this level, all entries with speeds higher than 240 mph were dropped since this is the typical highest speed for cars commonly used as taxi [in addition to the fact that the speed limit in NYC is 50 mph](http://nytrafficticket.com/fastest-road-in-america-and-maximum-speed-limits-in-new-york/).

Can we say that people restrain themselves to tipping more money as the cost of the ride becomes more and more expensive? Or since the fare grows with the length of the trip and trip duration, can we say that riders get bored and don't appreciate the service they are getting?

The null hypothesis for t-test is that the mean is the same in two tested samples. We will see that the speed is not really different in all weeks. From the hypothesis test, we see that we don't have enough evidence that speeds are different in Week 2 and Week 3 are significantly different hence we fail to reject the null hypothesis at 95% level of confidence. The rest of the weeks have smaller p-values, so **we can reject the null hypothesis and say that they are significantly different. In general, the speed can be dependent of the week of the month. It would be interesting to look at data of August and October as well**"
